## About Me ðŸ¥€ðŸŽ§ðŸ“š
Hello! My Name is Amir Mohammadi, I am an aspiring Computer Scientist hoping to pursue Full Stack development. 

I am currently enrolled in the University of Manitoba in the Honours Degree of Computer Science heading into my third year. I Aspire to learn many new things and programming skills along the way! My current specialties are in Java, C++ and JavaScript. I enjoy making small interactive games such as idle games or browser games. Beyond programming my hobbies include reading novels (fantasy and sci-fi are my prefered genres, but mystery and romance I also enjoy), writing stories, playing games and listening to all genre's of music (R&B and Jazz are my favourite however). Some of my more immediate goals is to deepen my skills with webDevelopment and make more interactive websites. 

I am eager and excited to learn!
